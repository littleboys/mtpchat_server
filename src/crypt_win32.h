 * by David Burren <davidb@werj.com.au>.
 *
 * An excellent reference on the underlying algorithm (and related
 * algorithms) is:

 *	B. Schneier, Applied Cryptography: protocols, algorithms,
 *	and source code in C, John Wiley & Sons, 1994.
 *
 * Note that in that book's description of DES the lookups for the initial,
 * pbox, and final permutations are inverted (this has been brought to the
 * attention of the author).  A list of errata for this book has been
 * posted to the sci.crypt newsgroup by the author and is available for FTP.
